Lightbox progress bar - front end assignment


Notes: 

For IE 8 compatability (round button, background transparency and gradients) I used background images. It could also be done in IE8 using plugins and some additional CSS (filter, -ms-filter), but a sprite needs to be used anyhow, and I think this is ends up being cleaner code.
